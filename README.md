# 📘 Syllabus OS

**The Open-Source University Engine.**
*Your personal AI university. Built from the world’s best curricula. Guided by you.*

### 🎯 The Thesis
**The "Degree" is outdated. The "Skill" is everything.**

We are in a weird spot.
* **University** gives you structure and prestige, but often lacks practical, modern skills (and costs £30k).
* **YouTube/Udemy** gives you infinite content, but zero direction. You drown in tutorials without a map.

**Syllabus OS** is the bridge.
It is an open, modular, AI-powered platform that parses the best Computer Science curricula in the world (Harvard, UCL, MIT) and reconstructs them into an interactive, project-based roadmap.

It’s like building your own degree with tools that **feel like Notion**, **think like DeepSeek**, and **flow like Duolingo**.

### 🏗️ How it Works (The MVP)

We aren't just generating random quizzes. We are building a **Graph-Based Learning Engine**.

* **📚 The Curriculum Core:** We scrape and standardize syllabi from top universities to create a "Golden Path" of what you *actually* need to know (Data Structures, Algorithms, Distributed Systems).
* **🧠 The Socratic Engine:** Powered by **DeepSeek v3.2** (for reasoning) and **Gemini 3** (for context), the AI doesn't just give you answers. It acts as a Tutor, asking *you* questions to ensure you understand the core concepts.
* **🧪 The Sandbox:** A built-in coding environment where you prove your skills. You don't pass a module by watching a video; you pass by shipping a commit.
* **📂 Verifiable Proof:** Every completed module pushes a project to your GitHub. By the end, you don't have a certificate; you have a portfolio.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Built for the AI-native web.

| Component | Tech |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React + Tailwind (Notion-style minimalism) |
| **Backend** | Python (FastAPI) |
| **Data & Vectors** | Supabase (Postgres + pgvector) |
| **Reasoning Model** | **DeepSeek v3.2** (Logic & Code Review) |
| **Context Model** | **Gemini 3 Flash** (Reading heavy documentation/textbooks) |
| **Orchestration** | Custom Agent Swarm (No heavy frameworks) |

### 🚧 Current Status: Research Preview

*Note: This is currently a passion project in active research & development.*

**What exists today:**
* [x] Year 1 CS Curriculum Graph (based on UCL/Warwick structures)
* [x] Basic Project Prompts & Assessment Logic
* [ ] Interactive Coding Sandbox (In Progress)

**Coming later in 2026:**
* "Learning Tree" Visualization
* GitHub Portfolio Automation

### 🤝 Credits & Inspiration

This project stands on the shoulders of giants:
* **Curricula:** Structure inspired by public syllabi from Warwick, UCL, and Loughborough.
* **Tools:** Inspired by the UX of **Notion**, the interactivity of **Scrimba**, and the flow of **Replit**.
