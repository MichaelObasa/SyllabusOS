# 📘 Syllabus (working title)

**Your own personal AI university. Built from the world’s best. Guided by you.**

Syllabus is an open, modular, AI-powered learning platform that takes the best university Computer Science degrees (Harvard, UCL, Warwick, etc.) and turns them into a fully interactive, project-based journey - without the lectures, gatekeeping, or £30K debt.

It’s like building your own degree with tools that feel like Notion, think like GPT, and flow like Duolingo.

## 🎯 Why this exists

1. Most people don’t need a degree. They need skills. They need proof. And they need structure.
2. University gives you prestige but not always practice.
3. YouTube gives you content but no direction.
4. Bootcamps give you urgency but not affordability.

Syllabus gives you:
- A clear, modular path from beginner to advanced.
- Real academic material, transformed into real-world projects.
- An AI assistant that actually helps you learn, not just give you answers.
- A growing portfolio of proof, not just completed videos.

## 🛠️ What you get (MVP)

- 📚 **Modular curriculum builder** based on real CS degree syllabi (Loughborough, UCL, etc.)
- 🧠 **Learning trees** to guide your path from basics to mastery
- 🎯 **Project prompts + assessments** in every module
- 💬 **AI Tutor** (powered by GPT) for help, feedback, and nudges
- 🧪 **Coding sandbox** to practice and build inside the platform
- 📂 **Portfolio output** — push projects to GitHub, blogs, or resumes

## 🚧 Current Status

This is the early MVP. We're:
- Starting with Year 1 CS content
- Using public syllabi and AI to build paths
- Focusing on clarity and real skill development
